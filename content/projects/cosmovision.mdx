## Roadmap

Working along with indigenous communities, anthropologists, historians and more experts with whom we will build digital museums that transmit in depth and from different angles the diversity and ancestral indigenous worldview is one of our main objectives.

The elements that make up the indigenous worldview will be embodied in pieces of knowledge contained in ERC-721 tokens. Thus, having NFTs museums that preserve and show the world the worldview of the different indigenous peoples and nationalities without any control on them. In the initial phase we are going to build the museum of the Kichwa Community.

## A social project

The main focus is to finance the construction of the museum that will be done through the sale of the first collection of 1000 NFTs where 950 are going to be minted and 50 are going to put in auction. Each of them will have a unique historical value that will make up the museum. In this way we will add more people to our tribe (Holders of NFTs, collaborators and institutions that join the project) interested in the preservation of the indigenous worldview.

## Â¿What's next...?

In subsequent phases of the project, more museums and collections of NFTs from the Kichwa community and other indigenous peoples and nationalities will be created. As new sources of income will also be added to maintain the sustainability of the project, for example, at some point of the project we are looking forward to implement auctions for the high value NFT's of the collection.
